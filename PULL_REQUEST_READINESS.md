# How to Make Pull Requests Ready for Review

This document provides step-by-step instructions for making the draft pull requests in this repository ready for review and merging.

## Current Status

✅ **Repository Infrastructure Ready**
- Added comprehensive `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts and dependencies
- Added GitHub Actions CI workflow for automated testing on pull requests
- Verified that the application builds successfully (`npm run build` ✅)
- Verified that the development server runs correctly (`npm run dev` ✅)

**Note**: As of issue #10, the Videos functionality has been merged into the Procedures tab. All video-related PRs are no longer needed as the functionality is now part of the main application.

## Pull Requests to Make Ready

### 1. PR #4: "Add KPI Dashboard with SQL schema, views, and React components" 
**Status**: Draft ➜ Ready to mark as ready for review

**What it includes:**
- ✅ Complete SQL database schema (12 tables)
- ✅ KPI views for business metrics (11 materialized views) 
- ✅ React dashboard components (`KPIs.jsx`, `KPICards.jsx`)
- ✅ Demo seed data for testing
- ✅ Clean integration with existing app (minimal changes)
- ✅ No secrets or service keys committed
- ✅ Builds successfully
- ✅ Includes proper error handling and fallbacks

**To make ready:**
1. Go to https://github.com/joegibsonoil12-source/KPI-Dashboard/pull/4
2. Click "Ready for review" button to remove draft status
3. The CI workflow will automatically run and validate the build

## Videos PRs Status

~~Previously, there were several PRs (#1, #2, #3) related to Videos functionality. As of issue #10, all video functionality has been integrated into the Procedures tab, so these PRs are no longer needed and can be closed.~~

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **PR #4** (KPI Dashboard) - Ready to review and merge ✅  
2. **Close Videos PRs** - PRs #1, #2, #3 can be closed as functionality is now in Procedures tab

## Testing Instructions

Before marking PRs as ready for review, verify:

### For All PRs:
```bash
# Build succeeds
npm run build

# Development server starts
npm run dev

# No console errors in browser
```

### For PR #4 (KPI Dashboard):
1. Navigate to the KPIs tab in the app
2. Verify demo data displays correctly when Supabase is not configured
3. Verify the SQL files contain valid schema (no syntax errors)

### For Procedures Tab (Video Functionality):
1. Navigate to the Procedures tab in the app  
2. Test video URL input and attachment to procedures
3. Verify YouTube/Vimeo/Loom embed functionality
4. Test video file upload (if Supabase is configured)

## CI/CD Workflow

The new CI workflow will automatically:
- ✅ Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
- ✅ Build the project (`npm run build`)  
- ✅ Check that build artifacts are created
- ✅ Run linting (if available)
- ✅ Run tests (if available)
- ✅ Provide feedback on PR readiness

## Security Checklist

Before merging any PR, ensure:
- ❌ No secrets or API keys are committed
- ❌ No sensitive customer data is included
- ✅ Demo data is safe and realistic but not real
- ✅ Environment variables are properly documented
- ✅ No build artifacts are committed

## Deployment Considerations

The repository is configured for GitHub Pages deployment with:
- ✅ Automated build on push to `main` 
- ✅ Vite configuration for GitHub Pages
- ✅ Supabase environment variables support
- ✅ Base URL configuration for subdirectory hosting

Once PRs are merged to `main`, GitHub Actions will automatically deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Mark PR #4 as ready for review (it's the most complete and independent)
2. **Close**: Close video-related PRs #1, #2, #3 as functionality is now in Procedures tab
3. **Test**: Verify PR #4 works correctly in isolation  
4. **Merge**: Merge PR #4 to main
5. **Deploy**: Changes will auto-deploy to GitHub Pages once merged

## Support

If you encounter any issues with these instructions:
1. Check the CI workflow results for specific build errors
2. Review the PR file changes for any obvious conflicts
3. Test locally with `npm install && npm run build && npm run dev`
4. Ensure no secrets are accidentally committed before merging
