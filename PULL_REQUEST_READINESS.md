To avoid conflicts, consider merging in this order:

1. **PR #1** (Videos foundation) - Already ready ✅
2. **PR #4** (KPI Dashboard) - Independent feature ✅  
3. **PR #2** (Enhanced Videos UI) - Builds on PR #1
4. **PR #3** (Supabase integration) - Final integration layer

## Testing Instructions

Before marking PRs as ready for review, verify:

### For All PRs:
```bash
# Build succeeds
npm run build

# Development server starts
npm run dev

# No console errors in browser
```

### For PR #4 (KPI Dashboard):
1. Navigate to the KPIs tab in the app
2. Verify demo data displays correctly when Supabase is not configured
3. Verify the SQL files contain valid schema (no syntax errors)

### For Video PRs (#1, #2, #3):
1. Navigate to the Videos tab in the app  
2. Test video URL input and display
3. Verify Supabase settings interface (if included)
4. Test YouTube/Vimeo embed functionality (if included)

## CI/CD Workflow

The new CI workflow will automatically:
- ✅ Install dependencies (`npm ci`)
- ✅ Build the project (`npm run build`)  
- ✅ Check that build artifacts are created
- ✅ Run linting (if available)
- ✅ Run tests (if available)
- ✅ Provide feedback on PR readiness

## Security Checklist

Before merging any PR, ensure:
- ❌ No secrets or API keys are committed
- ❌ No sensitive customer data is included
- ✅ Demo data is safe and realistic but not real
- ✅ Environment variables are properly documented
- ✅ No build artifacts are committed

## Deployment Considerations

The repository is configured for GitHub Pages deployment with:
- ✅ Automated build on push to `main` 
- ✅ Vite configuration for GitHub Pages
- ✅ Supabase environment variables support
- ✅ Base URL configuration for subdirectory hosting

Once PRs are merged to `main`, GitHub Actions will automatically deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Mark PR #4 as ready for review (it's the most complete and independent)
2. **Review**: Examine PRs #2 and #3 for any conflicts or issues
3. **Test**: Verify each PR works correctly in isolation  
4. **Merge**: Follow the recommended order to avoid conflicts
5. **Deploy**: Changes will auto-deploy to GitHub Pages once merged

## Support

If you encounter any issues with these instructions:
1. Check the CI workflow results for specific build errors
2. Review the PR file changes for any obvious conflicts
3. Test locally with `npm install && npm run build && npm run dev`
4. Ensure no secrets are accidentally committed before merging
