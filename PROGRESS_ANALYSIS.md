## 🎯 Next Steps and Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Review and Merge Outstanding PRs** (if they still exist)
   - Check status of PRs #1-4 mentioned in PULL_REQUEST_READINESS.md
   - Verify each PR still applies to current main branch
   - Follow the recommended merge order to avoid conflicts

2. **Validate Database Migrations**
   - Ensure all SQL migrations are applied to production database
   - Verify RLS policies are working correctly
   - Test delivery tickets and attachments functionality end-to-end

3. **Test and Stabilize Recent Changes**
   - Verify procedure attachments work correctly
   - Test delivery tickets CRUD operations
   - Ensure video migrations are applied successfully
   - Test Supabase functions deployment

### Medium-Term Goals

4. **Complete Video Management Features**
   - Review and merge video-related PRs (#1, #2, #3)
   - Implement video transcoding service (services/README.md documents this)
   - Test YouTube/Vimeo embed functionality
   - Verify Supabase settings integration

5. **Enhance KPI Dashboard**
   - Deploy KPI views and materialized views (PR #4)
   - Test demo data and Supabase integration
   - Verify KPI cards and dashboard components render correctly

6. **Improve Testing Coverage**
   - Add automated tests for critical paths
   - Test authentication flows
   - Verify RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
   - Test file uploads and attachment functionality

### Long-Term Improvements

7. **Documentation**
   - Update README with setup instructions
   - Document environment variables required
   - Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
   - Create developer onboarding guide

8. **Code Quality**
   - Reduce need for reverts by improving testing
   - Add pre-merge validation checks
   - Consider adding TypeScript for better type safety
   - Implement code review checklist

9. **Performance Optimization**
   - Review and optimize database queries
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Optimize frontend bundle size
   - Add loading states and error boundaries

## 🛠️ Technical Debt to Address

1. **Multiple Revert PRs**: Indicates need for better testing before merge
2. **Draft PRs**: Several PRs sitting in draft status need review
3. **Merge Conflicts**: Follow recommended merge order to minimize conflicts
4. **Environment Setup**: Ensure all team members have proper env vars configured

## 📊 Metrics & Progress

- **Total Merged PRs (Recent)**: 8+ PRs merged in past month
- **Open/Draft PRs**: 4 mentioned in readiness doc (status unclear)
- **Infrastructure**: ✅ CI/CD, ✅ Build, ✅ Dev server
- **Database**: ✅ Migrations, ✅ RLS policies, ✅ Tables created

## 🚀 Recommended Next Action

**Start with:** Check the actual status of PRs #1-4 mentioned in PULL_REQUEST_READINESS.md
- If they exist and are ready, follow the merge order
- If they don't exist or are stale, update PULL_REQUEST_READINESS.md
- Consider creating a new PR to clean up the readiness documentation

**Then:** Focus on testing and stabilizing the features added in recent PRs:
- Delivery tickets with attachments
- Procedure attachments
- Video migrations
- Supabase functions deployment

This will ensure the recent work is solid before adding new features.
